## Installation with Laravel/Homestead (recommended)
In order to set up the development environment in your local machine, [Laravel Homestead] (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead) provides a wonderful development environment without requiring to install PHP, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine. 

I recommend installing [per project] (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead#per-project-installation)

## Installation with XAMPP
For [XAMPP] (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) installation and set up, please check this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9em7Ey00xQ)
